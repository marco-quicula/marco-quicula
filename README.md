## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Marco QuiÃ§ula!

I'm a **Tech Lead** and **Senior Software Engineer**â€”organized, responsible, self-taught, and deeply passionate about crafting robust, secure, and scalable software solutions, especially with **Java technologies**.

Throughout my career, I've become a recognized technical reference, valued for my commitment to quality, innovation, and mentoring teams toward collective growth. My goal is always to foster collaboration and create meaningful solutions that drive digital transformation.

I truly believe innovation emerges from open dialogue and constant exchange of ideasâ€”not only about code but also about life, career development, and new tech challenges.

Feel free to explore my projects, contribute, or reach out.  
Let's build something amazing together! ðŸš€âœ¨
